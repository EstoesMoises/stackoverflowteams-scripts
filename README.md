# JS Scripts for Stack Overflow Teams and Enterprise API v3

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to demonstrate how to interact with the Stack Overflow Teams and Enterprise API (Version 3). These scripts serve as practical examples for developers aiming to leverage the API in their own projects.

Currently, only JS scripts are included, but the repository may be expanded in the future to include scripts in other programming languages. See the 'Contributing' section below for more details.

## Prerequisites for JS Scripts

A basic understanding of JavaScript is recommended. 

Rather than running the scripts directly, it’s advisable to review them in your code editor first. Analyze the code, modify it to suit your requirements, and use it as a learning resource.

If you want to execute the scripts, ensure you have the following:

1. **Node.js Installed**: These scripts require Node.js to run. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if it is not already installed on your system.
2. **API Access**: You need a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Stack Overflow instance and a valid bearer token for API authentication.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Execute a script with the following command:

   ```bash
   node nameofthescript.cjs
   ```

4. When prompted, provide the necessary details, such as:
   - The FQDN (e.g., `https://example.stackenterprise.co`)
   - The bearer token (used for API authentication)

## Scripts Overview

Each script is designed to provide a clear example of how to interact with specific endpoints or features of the Stack Overflow Teams and Enterprise API. Typical use cases include:

- Fetching user information
- Querying posts and tags
- Managing teams and content

Refer to the inline comments in each script for detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

## Customization

You are encouraged to customize these scripts to meet your specific needs. For example:

- Update the API endpoints to align with your requirements.
- Add extra parameters or headers to requests.
- Enhance the input prompts to gather more details.

## Contributing

If you’ve created an interesting script, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions in any programming language are welcome. As the repository evolves, folders for different languages can be created to organize contributions effectively. :)
